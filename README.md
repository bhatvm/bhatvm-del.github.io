With a decent bit of experience in the data space now, the contents here will include some of the things I have or am working on. (Present!/Past!)
While I don't necessarily stick to any specific field or domain per se, you will see a collective of projects with visuals across stock market, spotify data, sports etc. I would probably have picked that space at that time to try and explore some interesting patterns
